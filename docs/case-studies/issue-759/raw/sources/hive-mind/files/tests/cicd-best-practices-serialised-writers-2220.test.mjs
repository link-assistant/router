/**
 * @hive-mind-test-suite default
 *
 * Issue #2220. Principle 10 ("Concurrency Control") told every main-writing
 * job to share one repository-scoped group with `cancel-in-progress: false`,
 * and stopped there. The advice is correct and it is not sufficient: the group
 * orders the writers, it does not re-point their working trees.
 * `actions/checkout` checks out `github.sha`, so the second writer in the queue
 * starts one or more commits behind the branch it is about to push to, and its
 * push is rejected as non-fast-forward.
 *
 * link-foundation/browser-commander followed the principle to the letter --
 * three language releases in three workflow files, zero overlap in the
 * timings -- and two of the three releases still died on
 * `! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)`. The Rust crate reached
 * 0.10.11 on crates.io while `Cargo.toml` on `main` still said 0.9.0; the
 * Python package was never published at all.
 *
 * This test pins the missing half of the principle in all four translations,
 * the same shape as tests/cicd-best-practices-concurrency-2128.test.mjs, and
 * checks that this repository still implements the recovery the guide now
 * prescribes.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/issues/2220
 * @see https://github.com/link-foundation/browser-commander/issues/85
