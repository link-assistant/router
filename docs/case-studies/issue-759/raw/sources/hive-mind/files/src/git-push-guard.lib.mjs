/**
 * Blocking destructive git pushes from inside a routed task (issue #2164, R13).
 *
 * The issue asks that agents lose the *physical ability* to destroy data:
 * "immediately apply block of all delete operations or history changes like git
 * reset and so on detected up on git push". A `git reset` is harmless on its
 * own — nothing is lost until the rewritten history reaches the remote — so the
 * point where the damage becomes real, and therefore the point worth guarding,
 * is the push.
 *
 * Three layers were planned for R13. This module is layer 2:
 *
 *   1. Branch protection on the remote (`src/protect-branch.mjs`) — server-side
 *      and unbypassable, but only covers branches somebody protected.
 *   2. This `pre-push` hook — covers every branch and every remote in the task
 *      container, costs nothing, and is defeated by `git push --no-verify`.
 *   3. The router's git transport (`/git/…`), which routed tasks now push
 *      through. It is unbypassable for the same reason the model traffic is —
 *      the task holds no other credential — and it refuses branch deletions
 *      outright (measured: `git push origin :refs/heads/x` → HTTP 403).
 *
 * Layer 3 originally covered deletions but not force pushes: the router decided
 * by looking for a `force-ref-updates` capability that git never sends, so a
 * non-fast-forward push was relayed unchanged (measured in
 * `experiments/issue-2164/probe-git-transport.sh`, reported upstream as
 * link-assistant/router#272). That was fixed in link-assistant/router#273 and
 * ships from 0.110.0, which is at or below the pin — the router now asks
 * GitHub's compare API whether the proposed tip is ahead of the current one and
 * fails closed when it cannot tell.
 *
 * So this hook is no longer the only thing standing between an agent and a
 * rewritten branch. It is still worth keeping: it is the layer that applies to
 * every remote rather than only the routed one, it costs nothing, and it stops
 * the push locally instead of after a round trip. It remains defeated by
 * `--no-verify`, so it is a speed bump and the docs say so.
 *
 * The hook is delivered by mounting a host directory read-only into the task
 * container and pointing git at it with `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0`
 * (git >= 2.31). Env vars rather than `git config --global` because the task's
 * `~/.gitconfig` is bind-mounted from the *host*: writing to it would reconfigure
 * the operator's own machine.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/link-assistant/hive-mind/issues/2164

 *     the remote — the shape a `git reset --hard` + `push --force` takes.
 *
 * A remote sha we do not have locally is refused too: it cannot be proven to be
