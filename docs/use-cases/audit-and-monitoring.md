# Use case: auditing and monitoring per-task usage

> **Goal** — answer "which task token made which request, against which
> subscription, and how many requests and upstream-reported tokens has it
> spent?" both live and after the
> fact.

This is the observability half of [per-task-tokens.md](per-task-tokens.md).
Nothing here requires a client change; the router records what it already knows
when it authorises a request.

## Three views, three retention models

| View | Endpoint / file | Retention | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Prometheus counters | `GET /api/management/metrics` (admin only) | in-memory, resets on restart | dashboards, alerts |
| JSON snapshot | `GET /api/management/usage` (admin only) | in-memory, resets on restart | per-token inspection, scripts |
| Audit trail | `--audit-log <file>` (JSONL) | durable, append-only | forensics, compliance |
| Persisted budgets | `tokens list` | durable token store | quota enforcement |
| Subscription health | `GET /api/management/health/subscriptions` (admin only) | live | uptime checks, paging |

## Is the router serving what it advertises?

`/api/health` answers whether the *process* is up. It is wired to both the liveness
and readiness probes in `deploy/k8s/router.yaml`, so it deliberately stays `ok`
when a subscription dies: restarting the container cannot mint a new OAuth
token, and failing the probe would crash-loop a deployment that is still serving
its other providers.

Subscription health is a separate question with a separate answer:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/management/health/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROUTER_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

`200` means every configured subscription can serve. `503` names each one that
cannot, and why:

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "healthy_providers": ["codex"],
  "degraded_providers": [
    { "provider": "claude", "reason": "refresh token is no longer valid (invalid_grant): …" }
  ]
}
```

Only subscriptions this deployment is actually configured for are reported, so
"claude was never set up here" and "claude died twelve hours ago" cannot render
identically. The same state is scrapeable:

```
link_assistant_subscription_healthy{provider="claude"} 0
link_assistant_subscription_healthy{provider="codex"} 1
```

A revoked credential needs a human to re-authenticate — `router auth claude` —
so this is the signal worth paging on.

## Live per-token counters

Every authorised request is attributed to its token id (the JWT `sub`) and the
label the token was issued with. The detailed counters are available only from
the admin-gated `/api/management/usage` endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/management/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROUTER_ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq .token_calls
```

```json
{
  "550e8400-…": { "label": "issue-45-solver", "requests": 42 }
}
```

The count increments once per *authorised* request — the same unit
`--max-requests` budgets. Persisted `used_tokens/max_tokens` in `tokens list`
instead comes from actual vendor response usage and survives restarts.
`/api/management/metrics` exposes aggregate totals and status codes only; it
never emits token ids, token labels, or account names, and remains on the
management listener.

## Durable audit trail

The audit log is **off by default**. Enable it with a path:

```bash
router serve --audit-log /var/log/link-assistant/audit.jsonl
# or
AUDIT_LOG=/var/log/link-assistant/audit.jsonl router serve
```

One JSON object per line is appended as each request is authorised:

```json
{"time":"2026-08-07T12:00:00.123456+00:00","token_id":"550e8400-…","label":"issue-45-solver","provider":"codex","surface":"anthropic","path":"/api/services/anthropic/v1/messages","model":"catalog-model-id"}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `time` | RFC 3339 timestamp of the authorisation |
| `token_id` | Router token id — the JWT `sub`, **not** the token string |
| `label` | Label the token was issued with |
| `provider` | Upstream that served it: `anthropic`, `codex`, `gemini`, `qwen`, `gonka`, `crater`, `openai-compatible` |
| `surface` | Client-facing dialect: `anthropic`, `openai_chat`, `openai_responses` |
| `path` | Request path as the router saw it |
| `model` | Model the client asked for, when the body carried one (omitted otherwise) |

### What the log deliberately does not contain

- the `la_sk_…` token string,
- any vendor credential or `Authorization` header,
- prompt or completion content.

A unit test (`events_never_carry_the_token_string_or_credentials`) asserts the
first two. The file is therefore safe to ship to a shared log collector.

This content policy applies only to the optional audit log. The default request
log is a diagnostic record of complete exchanges and therefore includes prompt
and completion content. It partially masks long credentials and fully masks
short ones, but operators with access to `$DATA_DIR/requests` can read message
content and should protect and retain that directory accordingly.

### Rotation

Each write re-opens the file in append mode, so an external rotator
(`logrotate`, `copytruncate`, a container log driver) can move the file
underneath a running router without a restart. A failed write is logged as a
warning and dropped — auditing never takes the proxy down.

## Example queries

```bash
# requests per label, from the audit log
jq -r .label audit.jsonl | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# which upstream a task actually used (useful when bridging is enabled)
jq -r 'select(.label=="issue-45-solver") | [.surface,.provider,.model] | @tsv' audit.jsonl | sort -u

# tokens that are close to their budget
router tokens list
```

```promql
# Prometheus: aggregate request rate over 5 minutes
rate(link_assistant_requests_total[5m])
```
